This is the frontend and backend files that I am using for a Pokemon TCG Pocket Trading Website. 

The goal of this website is to create a place where people who are playing the new Pokemon TCG Pocket mobile game can connect with people and trade virtual cards.
Although as of 11/25/2024, trading is not yet available in the game, when it becomes available, the hope is that this website will be an effective way for people
to find others to trade with and get the cards they are looking for.
